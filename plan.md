As a user when I submit the form it should show me that it is submitting.
use the 'success' mesage in state

As a user I should not be able to submit again while it is submitting.
As a user when I submit the form in a correct way (passes validation) I should see the form replaced with a simple success message.
As a user when I submit the form in an incorrect way I should see that the form is no longer submitting and that there are errors.

Hiding form on success

when status = success then show message(div/P)

To do:

- add fields for contact information
  -As a user who has incorrectly submitted the form I should see an error under each field that has failed validation. 
  -The error should be specific to the field ("Not a valid phone number", "No bookings outside of England, Wales or Scotland").

all state data into array
loop through array with array.foreach if true, change value in array to true
any arrays true, send specific dispatch message
